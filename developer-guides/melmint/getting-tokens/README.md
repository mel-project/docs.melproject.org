# ðŸª™ Getting tokens

Acquiring **"mainnet"** tokens:

* Run a [`melminter`](using-melminter.md) instance - this rewards you with ERG, which can be immediately swapped for other tokens in the liquidity pools (e.g. MEL, SYM)
* If you already have some MEL, SYM, or ERG, you can swap them for other tokens using [Melswap](../../using-wallets/melswap-guide.md)

Acquiring **testnet** tokens: use the [faucet functionality](../../using-wallets/getting-started.md#fund-wallet).

Our native tokens are currently **not** listed on any exchange yet. Be aware of possible scams!
